# Mahsa Asadi

## 📖 Bio
Mahsa's research is motivated by a fascination with the human mind and the mathematical foundations of learning. Her work lies at the intersection of theoretical reinforcement learning and human modeling. She earned her PhD in Computer Science from Inria Lille, France, with a dissertation on "Identifying Structure in Online and Collaborative Learning Problems", where she provided theoretical insights into sample complexity and regret bounds.
During her postdoctoral research at Aalto University's Probabilistic Machine Learning group, she explored Human-in-the-Loop Decision Making where she gained expertise in human modeling.
In our team, Mahsa will be working on modeling a secure agent capable of collecting information by querying other agents within a network.
