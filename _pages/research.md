## Federated Learning: Computational and Statistical Innovations

### Federated Learning for Network-Structured Data

The era of big data over networks demands solutions for handling interconnected, heterogeneous datasets. A prime example is pandemic management, where wearables and smartphones generate local datasets tied by physical, social, or biological network structures. These datasets often vary in statistical properties but exhibit intrinsic relationships.

My research introduces **networked exponential families**, a cutting-edge probabilistic model that enables:

- **Adaptive Data Pooling:** Groups similar datasets to build personalized predictions.  
- **Privacy-Preserving Techniques:** Ensures data confidentiality in federated settings.  
- **Scalable Optimization:** Employs robust methods to handle imperfections in data and computation.

## Explainable AI (XAI): Personalized and Transparent Models

### Building Trust Through Personalized Explainability

For AI systems to gain widespread acceptance, their predictions must be explainable. My research focuses on developing personalized explanations tailored to individual users. By measuring the reduction in conditional entropy, this method ensures explanations align with the user’s knowledge and needs.

**Key Features:**

- **User-Centric Explanations:** Accounts for user background and preferences.  
- **Model-Agnostic Framework:** Compatible with any machine learning model.  
- **Efficient Implementation:** Requires minimal training data—just data points, predictions, and user-provided summaries.
