Welcome to my academic website! I'm a PostDoc in the <a href="https://ml4bigdata.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Machine Learning Research Group</a> at Aalto University, led by 
<a href="https://ml4bigdata.github.io/alex_jung/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Jung</a>, with a broad interest in the foundations of machine learning. 
Feel free to reach out if you are interested in <a href="https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=s1qhNzIAAAAJ&hl=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my work</a>! 
 
## 📖 Bio
<p>
Before joining Aalto University, I was a member of the <a href="https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/ai/research-groups/explainable-artificial-intelligence/team.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Explainable AI group at Fraunhofer HHI</a>.
Prior to this, I obtained my PhD in mathematics from RWTH Aachen University under supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KA2BM_UAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Holger Rauhut</a> for my <a href="https://publications.rwth-aachen.de/record/1012246" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dissertation</a> in statistical learning theory, at the intersection of Compressive Sensing and Deep Learning.
The overall goal of my research is to establish rigorous performance guaratuees for high-dimensional machine learning, typically drawing on tools from High-dimensional Probability and
leveraging on the Concentration of Measure phenomenon. 
I'm also part of the team behind the <a href="https://aaltodictionaryofml.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aalto Dictionary of Machine Learning</a>. <br><br>

<a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/freetools/collab-dist?source=1550644&target=189017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My Erdös number is 4</a>, via Holger Rauhut, Jürgen Prestin, and Charles Kam-tai Chui.

## 🔬 Research

I'm interested in a complementary view on machine learning, combining the perspectives of generalization and explainability.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Generalization:</strong> Asymptotic (e.g., via the Rademacher complexity) and non-asymptotic (based on random matrix theory) approaches.</li>
  <li><strong>Explainability:</strong> Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), and Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) for Large Language Models (LLMs).</li>
  <li><strong>Settings:</strong> From basic linear models to deep neural networks, federated learning, and reinforcement learning.</li>
  <li><strong>Tools:</strong> High-dimensional probability, random matrix theory (RMT), and (random) fixed-point methods.</li>
</ul>
