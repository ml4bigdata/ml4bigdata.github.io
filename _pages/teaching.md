# A Three-Component Perspective on Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is transforming our world, from personalized recommendations to autonomous systems. To effectively teach this complex field, we 
have developed a structured approach that simplifies ML concepts for diverse audiences.

## The Three Fundamental Components of ML

Any ML method can be decomposed into three core components:

1. **Data Representation**: How we organize and structure the input data.
2. **Model Design**: The architecture or algorithm used to process the data.
3. **Loss Functions**: The criteria used to evaluate and optimize the model's performance.

This framework allows students from various disciplines to grasp the underlying principles of ML without delving into complex mathematics.

## Evidence-Based Teaching Approach

Our courses emphasize active learning and conceptual clarity through:

- **Interactive Learning**: Utilizing online quizzes and coding assignments.
- **Project-Based Assessments**: Engaging students in hands-on projects to apply ML concepts.
- **Practical Exercises**: Providing Python notebooks hosted on [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.cs.aalto.fi) for real-world experience.

These methods ensure that students not only understand ML theory but also gain practical skills applicable in various fields.

## Teaching Philosophy

- **Concise Lectures**: Focused on specific learning objectives to maintain student engagement.
- **Curated Resources**: Including textbooks like ["Machine Learning: The Basics"](https://link.springer.com) by A. Jung, YouTube playlists, and GitHub repositories.
- **Feedback-Adaptive Cycle**: Regularly updating course materials based on student feedback to enhance learning outcomes.

## Recognition and Impact

- **Teaching Assistant of the Year 2020**: Awarded by the Aalto School of Science to Shamsiiat Abudrakhmanova, Aalto University. [click me](https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/sci-awards-2020-celebrate-our-successes-in-a-challenging-year#8-teaching-assistant-of-the-year)
- **Teacher of the Year 2018**: Awarded by the Department of Computer Science to Alex Jung, Aalto University. [click me](/assets/images/TeacherAward.png)
- **High Student Ratings**: Consistently positive evaluations in teaching assessments.
- **International Engagement**: Invited speaker and lecturer at multiple institutions and conferences worldwide.
