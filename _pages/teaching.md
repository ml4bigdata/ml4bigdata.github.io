# A Three-Component Perspective on Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is transforming our world, from personalized recommendations to autonomous systems. To effectively teach this complex field, we 
have developed a structured approach that simplifies ML concepts for diverse audiences.

## The Three Fundamental Components of ML

Any ML method can be decomposed into three core components:

1. **Data Representation**: How we organize and structure the input data.
2. **Model Design**: The architecture or algorithm used to process the data.
3. **Loss Functions**: The criteria used to evaluate and optimize the model's performance.

This framework allows students from various disciplines to grasp the underlying principles of ML without 
delving into unnecessarily complicated mathematics (which is often overkill).

## Evidence-Based Teaching Approach

Our courses emphasize active learning and conceptual clarity through:

- **Interactive Learning**: Utilizing online quizzes and coding assignments.
- **Project-Based Assessments**: Engaging students in hands-on projects to apply ML concepts.
- **Peer-Review**: Arguably the main tool of science is critical assessment by peers (peer review). We try to 
train students in giving and receiving critical feedback. 
- **Learning by Doing**: Theoretical concepts need to be taught and learnt using hands-on assignments, e.g., 
using [Python notebooks](https://github.com/alexjungaalto/TeachingPublic/tree/master/MLwP) 

## Teaching Philosophy

- **Concise Lectures**: Focused on specific learning objectives to maintain student engagement.
- **Curated Resources**: Including textbooks like ["Machine Learning: The Basics"](https://link.springer.com) by A. Jung, YouTube playlists, and GitHub repositories.
- **Feedback-Adaptive Cycle**: Regularly updating course materials based on student feedback to enhance learning outcomes. Here is an example 
for a feedback letter that explains how student feedback has been leveraged in the course revision: [click me](/assets/images/ResponseLetter.pdf)

## Recognition and Impact

- **Most popular course at FiTech**: Our course *CS-EJ3211 Machine Learning with Python* has faced the largest registration numbers 
among the entire Finnish network university (FiTech). It also received outstanding student feedback. [click me](/assets/images/MLwPythonBestCourse.pdf) 
- **Teaching Assistant of the Year 2020**: Awarded by the Aalto School of Science to Shamsi Abdurakhmanova, Aalto University. [click me](https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/sci-awards-2020-celebrate-our-successes-in-a-challenging-year#8-teaching-assistant-of-the-year)
- **Teacher of the Year 2018**: Awarded by the Department of Computer Science to Alex Jung, Aalto University. [click me](/assets/images/TeacherAward.png)
- **High Student Ratings**: Consistently positive evaluations in teaching assessments.
- **International Engagement**: Invited speaker and lecturer at multiple institutions and conferences worldwide.
