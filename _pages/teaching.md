# Teaching Machine Learning at Aalto University

Machine Learning (ML) is reshaping how we live, work, and innovate. At Aalto University, our group develops 
and teaches ML with a focus on clarity, accessibility, and critical thinking. We believe that by breaking down 
ML into simple, universal components, students from all backgrounds can develop both intuition and technical skills.

## The Three Fundamental Components of ML

Any ML method can be decomposed into three core components:

1. **Data Representation** – How input data is organized and structured.  
2. **Model Design** – The architecture or algorithm that processes the data.  
3. **Loss Function** – The criterion used to evaluate and optimize model performance.  

This framework helps students understand ML principles without being overwhelmed by unnecessary mathematical formalism.

## Evidence-Based Teaching Approach

Our courses emphasize **active learning and conceptual clarity** through:

- **Interactive Quizzes and Coding Exercises** – reinforcing core concepts.  
- **Project-Based Assessments** – applying ML to real-world problems.  
- **Peer Review Training** – learning to give and receive constructive feedback, the cornerstone of science.  
- **Learning by Doing** – hands-on assignments using [Python notebooks](https://github.com/alexjungaalto/TeachingPublic/tree/master/MLwP).

## Teaching Philosophy

- **Concise Lectures** – focused on clear learning objectives.  
- **Curated Resources** – including the textbook [*Machine Learning: The Basics*](https://link.springer.com) by Alex Jung, our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@alexjung111), and [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/alexjungaalto).  
- **Feedback-Adaptive Cycle** – course materials are regularly revised based on student feedback.

- ⭐ **High Student Ratings** – consistently excellent teaching evaluations.  
- 🌍 **International Engagement** – invited speaker and lecturer at institutions and conferences worldwide.  

## Our Approach in a Nutshell

We combine **conceptual clarity** (data, models, loss), **active learning** (projects, peer review, coding exercises), and 
**constant adaptation** (feedback-driven improvements). Our work has been recognized both in Finland and internationally, 
and we continue to make our teaching openly available whenever possible.
